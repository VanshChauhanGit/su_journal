          Guidelines for Writing Book Review
        </h1>

        <p className="mb-4">
          We invite academicians and others to write reviews of books on
          business management and allied subjects.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The book-reviewers are requested to follow the guidelines given below:
        </p>

        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-3 marker:font-bold marker:text-xl">
          <li>
            The reviewer should begin with a listing of the bibliographical
            details of the book, comprising the name(s) of the author(s), full
            title and sub-title of the book (as they appear on the cover),
            details of the place and name of the publisher, year of publication,
            number of pages in the book, whether hardbound or paperback, and the
            price, if mentioned. A photograph of the cover page of the book may
            also be attached.
          </li>
          <li>
            The review can range from 1000 to 3000 words, depending on the topic
            and the importance of the book.
          </li>
          <li>
            The review should engage with the theme of the book and the issues
            and problems raised, and should make a rigorous attempt to identify
            and assess the main arguments put forth by the author.
          </li>
          <li>
            The review should be written in the manner and style that would
            qualify it as a short article in its own right.
          </li>
          <li>
            The reviewer should provide a confirmation that the review has not
            been released for publication elsewhere, and that the author shall
            cede the copyright, if it is accepted for publication in{" "}
            <span className="italic font-semibold">
              NICE Journal of Business
            </span>
            .
          </li>
          <li>
            The book under review should have been published recently,
            preferably in the current or the previous year, and be preferably
            the new release.
          </li>
          <li>
            The reviewer should also comment on the stylistic aspects and
            literary presentation of the book.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bibliographical references may be avoided. If the references are
            considered essential, the citation style adopted by{" "}
            <span className="italic font-semibold">
              NICE Journal of Business
            </span>{" "}
            should be used.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p className="mt-6 italic text-gray-700 font-bold">
          Thus, the review should be an objective assessment of the book,
          indicating its specific strengths and weaknesses and an overall
          assessment.
        </p>

          Guidelines for Authors
        </h2>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <span className="italic font-semibold">NICE Journal of Business</span>{" "}
          invites academicians and professionals to contribute research papers,
          articles, abstracts of doctoral dissertations, major research project
          reports, case studies, comprehensive bibliography, and book reviews.
          The following are the guidelines for authors:
        </p>

        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-3 marker:font-bold marker:text-xl">
          <li>
            The contribution must be{" "}
            <span className="font-semibold">original</span>, neither published
            nor under consideration for publication anywhere else.
          </li>
          <li>
            The <span className="font-semibold">cover page</span> should contain
            the title of the paper, author’s name, designation, official
            address, contact phone number, and the e-mail address. The next page
            should contain an abstract of not more than 150 words, along with
            five key words. The main text should not contain author’s name.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Abstract of the paper should be in the structured format
            (Emerald’s pattern).
          </li>
          <li>
            The References should be given at the end of the manuscript and
            should contain only those cited in the text of the manuscript. These
            should be given in an alphabetical order of the first author’s
            surname, and should follow the APA style.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Notes (Footnotes) should be avoided. If they are considered
            necessary, they should be indicated by serial number in the text (1,
            2, 3…) as also at the end on a separate page, on a separate sheet,
            just after the references. The notes should not be mixed with the
            references.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Tables and Figures should be numbered consecutively in
            international numerals, and should appear soon after the text where
            they are cited first. The figures should be accommodated within
            two-thirds of the A-4 size paper. All the figures and tables must be
            suitably numbered and captioned.
          </li>
          <li>
            Please check your manuscript for clarity, grammar, spelling,
            punctuation, and consistency of references to minimize the editorial
            changes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Please follow the British spelling throughout: ‘programme’, not
            ‘program’; ‘organisation’, not ‘organization’; ‘behaviour’, not
            ‘behavior’.
          </li>
          <li>
            The use of capitalisation should be kept to the minimum, except in
            case of proper nouns, and should be followed consistently.
          </li>
          <li>
            The ideal size of the manuscript is 5,000 to less than 7,500 words.
          </li>
          <li>
            The manuscript should be in the double-space, in 12-pt font size, on
            the A-4 size paper, leaving 4cms margin on all sides, so as to
            facilitate editing and styling. All texts, including those of the
            references and notes, should be typed in double-space.
          </li>
          <li>
            The authors using a questionnaire for collection of data for
            preparing the paper should append a copy of the questionnaire, along
            with the manuscript.

            The contribution may be sent in an e-mail attachment, addressed to{" "}

          It is over the past six months, the war has not gone well for either
          party. The tug of war between the US-led supply of arms and
          intelligence to Ukraine and the resourceful and resilient Russia can
          only drag on, indefinitely. The time for resuming negotiations is now.
          India, which has consistently held dialogue and diplomacy as the only
          solution to take the initiative towards mediation. Prof. Shrawan Kumar
          Singh has analysed the various aspects of conflict between Russia and
          Ukraine.

          Dr. Ajai Pal Sharma and Dr. Arun Yadav examine the influence of
          service quality on customer satisfaction in the context of Indian
          retailing, and attempt to ascertain the relationship between customer
          satisfaction and service quality. Their study reveals that out of a
          total of five factors, three factors of retail service quality,
          physical appearance, personal interaction, and problem-solving
          contribute significantly to service quality while assessing customer
          satisfaction.

          Dr. Smita Tripathi identifies the determinants of the adoption of
          FinTech in selected rural areas of north India's states of
          Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, and Punjab. She also assesses the impact
          of demographic variables on FinTech adoption. Her study has revealed
          that the primary factors of FinTech adoption among the rural
          population are: trust, perceived ease of use, safety, perceived risk,
          perceived value earned, and perceived usefulness. She also finds that
          the acceptance and experience of digital payments are influenced by
          demographic factors, including the user's age, education, and gender.

        <p>
          Priyanka Kumari and Dr. Shivendra examine the factors that
          substantially shape customers' perception of service quality in
          India's health insurance sector. They find that six factors, namely,
          inerrancy in receptiveness, understanding the customer, inculcating
          certitude, infallible physical appearance, corporeal evidence, and
          discretion towards customers, were the major factors in determining
          the service quality perception in the health insurance.

          Ankita Mandoliya and Prof. H. C. Purohit take an integrative view of
          ethnocentrism among Indian consumers and that there is strong
          relationship between consumer ethnocentrism, demographic antecedents,
          consumers' product judgment, and willingness to buy. Their study
          reveals that the Indian consumers have an ethnocentrism level below
          average as the mean value of the majority of the items on the
          ethnocentrism scale. This major drift of mean values towards the
          disagreement and a minority of items getting responses above-average
          represent a moderate to a below-moderate ethnocentric level of the
          consumers when automobiles are taken into consideration.

        <p>
          Resham Goyal and Prof. R. C. Dangwal assess the impact of the Central
          Government's initiative 'Start-up India' on achieving social
          sustainability through employment generation. They highlight the role
          played by the Start-up India initiative in stimulating employment
          generation across various states in India. They find a strong
          influence of entrepreneurship on generating employment, enhancing
          social sustainability in the country.

        <p>
          Dr. Kiran Lamba and Dr. Indra Jakhar analyse the trend of female
          labour force participation in India. They make an interstate
          comparison on the basis of level of income. They find that the female
          labour force participation rate (FLFPR) has declined over the time in
          all the states, both rural and urban areas. They argue that there is a
          need to improve access to education and training programmes, and skill
          development for enhancing the employability of women workers.

          In the Communication section, we have two pieces. In a brief
          communication, Prof. V.K. Shrotriya brings to light the use and abuse
          of Power Point Presentations in the classes and conferences. The
          author is of the view that over-dependence on PPTs is impacting the
          teaching-learning process negatively and requires revisiting this kind
          of pedagogy.

          Dr. Komal Nagar has provided the annotated bibliography on the works
          of Peter F. Drucker, one of the most celebrated authors on Business
          and Management of the 20th century. Along with the compilation of his
          works, her communication furnishes a brief description of the life of
          the legendary author.

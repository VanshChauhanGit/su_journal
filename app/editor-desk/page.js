          It is my pleasure to share with you the current issue of NICE Journal
          of Business (Vol. 18, No. 1: January-June 2023). The journal provides
          an outlet to researchers and scholars working in the field of
          business. Each issue of the journal brings to you the latest and
          authoritative insights into the dynamic and fascinating world of
          business. I hope you enjoy reading the contents of this issue.
        </p>

        <p>
          In this issue, we have put together one perspective, seven research
          papers, and two pieces of communication reflecting diverse interests
          in the vast field of business.
        </p>

        <p>
          This issue contains topics like digital lending, influence of
          transformational leadership on employees' job performance, market
          efficiency and volatility spillovers in the Indian commodity market,
          influence of organisational justice on perceived organisational
          support, influence of financial inclusion on the social status of
          rural women, impact of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016,
          digital supply chain in e-commerce, and determinants of employee
          engagement in Indian start-ups.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the contemporary scenario, digital lending has proved to be one of
          the major instruments contributing to financial inclusion in India.
          Ensuring safe, secure, reliable, accessible, affordable, and efficient
          payment systems have been one of the important strategic objectives of
          the RBI. Prof. Shrawan Kumar Singh writes on the framework, models,
          growth, and regulatory mechanism of digital lending in India, and
          cautions the readers that digital lending comes with its own set of
          precautions.

        <p>
          Nitin R. Gokarn, Dr. Praveen Kumar Mishra, and Prof. Avinash D.
          Pathardikar examine the influence of transformational leadership on
          job performance and the mediating role of self-efficacy. Their study
          reveals that transformational leadership influences job performance
          and self-efficacy positively. The study also identifies important
          attitude-markers that may be employed as soft management techniques to
          increase employee self-efficacy, which would improve work output for
          the employer.
        </p>

        <p>
          Dr. Mehak Arora and Prof. Ramesh Chander examine the informational
          efficiency of the Indian commodity market and the transmission of
          volatility in prices of traded commodities in spot and futures
          markets. They suggest a testament to underlying market efficiency, so
          that futures commodity markets effectively utilise a low market price
          acquisition platform for a seamless transmission of price sensitivity
          to the spot markets.
        </p>

        <p>
          Arti Negi and Dr. Reena Singh assess the influence of organisational
          justice on perceived organisational support among the teachers of
          higher-education institutions in the state of Uttarakhand. They find
          that all the three dimensions of justice (distributive, procedural and
          interactional) influence positively and significantly the perceived
          organisational support.
        </p>

        <p>
          Ritu Bharti and Prof. R. C. Dangwal assess the influence of financial
          inclusion on the social status of rural women in Uttarakhand. They
          used 38 scale items to draw the relevant findings using the PLS-SEM.
          They conclude that the access, availability and the usage of financial
          services are the significant factors influencing rural women towards
          financial inclusion. The authors also find a significant positive
          impact of financial inclusion on the social status of rural women in
          Uttrakhand.
        </p>

        <p>
          Ankita Rajput and Dr. Gautam Prasad examine the impact of the
          Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (IBC) on the public-sector banks
          in India. They find a significant impact of the enforcement of the IBC
          on the recovery of loans, profit and non-performing assets of these
          banks.
        </p>

        <p>
          Gunjan Marwah, Dr. B. M. Gupta, and Prof. Anurag Saxena conducted a
          bibliometric study of Digital Supply-Chain in e-Commerce, using
          quantitative as well as qualitative indicators from the year 2000 to
          March 2023. They find that out of the 515 global publications, China
          and the USA turned out to be the most published countries and Hong
          Kong Polytechnic University and Shanghai University were the Top 2
          impactful publishing organisations during that period.
        </p>

        <p>
          Ikshu Chauhan and Dr. Vaishali examine the key performance indicators
          of employee engagement in Indian start-ups. They identify the key
          performance indicators which assist the start-up business owners in
          evaluating their employee's performance and in formulating the
          strategies to optimise them. This might help the employers in employee
          retention, increasing the employee satisfaction, and evaluating the
          part played by employee engagement in start-ups.

          In the communication section, we have two pieces. In a brief note,
          Prof. V. K. Shrotriya throws a new idea and stresses the need for
          happiness in the organisation. The author underscores the idea that if
          the organisation's interest and focus are people-centric, it would be
          easier to realise the dream of a happy organisation.
        </p>

          Dr. Komal Nagar has given an annotated bibliography of the works of
          David Ogilvy, the legendary author on advertising. A brief description
          of the life of the author is also given.
        </p>

        <p>
          Many experts devoted their time and talent in reviewing the
          manuscripts, by making critical comments and suggestions for improving
          their quality. I am deeply indebted to all of them.

        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold">Plagiarists Beaware!</h2>
        <p>
          Plagiarism has become a major problem in the way of research and
          publications, and is widespread and going unabated. We often receive
          articles for publication which are either partly or fully copied from
          others’ works, despite the fact the author has given a declaration
          that the article is original and is an exclusive contribution to our
          journal, and has also submitted a certificate of cessation of
          copyright in our favour. The dare-devilry is shocking! This is
          outright deceit and cheating. Amusingly, the practice is not confined
          to Indian authors; foreign authors are no exception.
        </p>
        <p>
          This time again, we came across a concept of two such cases, of
          plagiarism from Indian and foreign authors. The articles could have
          gone into print, but for the alacrity and the incisive eye of our
          referees and editorial team.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have been facing another problem of somewhat similar nature,
          involving professional ethics. We spend a lot of efforts, time, and
          money in reviewing, short listing, and editing of each article which
          passes the preliminary scrutiny. When asked to make further revision
          or supply the missing information, some of the authors stop responding
          to us and submit the paper, which has been improved through our
          efforts, to some other journal. They do so despite their having given
          a declaration that the paper is an exclusive contribution to our
          journal, and shall not be withdrawn at a subsequent stage unless
          rejected/permitted by the Editor, and having ceded the copyright in
          our favour.
        </p>
        <p>
          It needs no emphasis that plagiarism is not only an unethical
          practice; particularly so for an academician, it is also a violation
          of the code of conduct governing the services of university teachers
          and research scholars. Moreover, it amounts to a criminal offence
          under the Copyright Act, 1957 (which certainly does not grant us a
          ‘right to copy!’). Any infringement of the copyright under the Act is
          an offence, punishable with imprisonment for a minimum period of six
          months, extendable up to three years, and a fine, ranging from Rs.
          50,000 to Rs. 2 lakhs.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is worthwhile to caution such unscrupulous people. Many people have
          already faced disciplinary action, eventually leading to their
          dismissal from service. These include university teachers at all
          levels– lecturers, associate professors, professors (including one in
          a top Central university, one in a top IIM, and one in a State
          university), and one Vice-Chancellor of a State university. In a
          recent case, the Vice-Chancellor of a reputed Central University had
          to face imprisonment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Writing research article is a demanding as well as a rewarding task. A
          person looking for an unearned reward is surely inviting trouble for
          himself and a bad name for the entire academic community.
